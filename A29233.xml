            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Theſe, former times have ever obſerved; and by their Obſervations happily ſucceeded. They made uſe of <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> as principall directions for State-government. They collected what was i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable, and they reduced them to uſe. They found no State ſo ſecure from foes abroad, or feares within, as it felt not many times the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile incurſion of the one, as well as the private intruſion of the other. This made them more ſecur'd, becauſe others miſhaps kept them from holding themſelves too ſecure. They obſerved the occaſions of riſing States, with the probable reaſons of their decline. They found a period to the moſt flouriſhing Empires, and gath'red
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47238:18"/> thence, (with a free and ingenuous acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their dependance upon another more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute independent power) no policy nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane providence could divert, what that Divine Soveraignty had decreed.</p>
               <p>This the prudent'ſt and powerfull'ſt have ſeene inſtanced, and in this Worlds Theatre preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in the diſcovery of them have trembled. Fooliſh wiſdome they found in whatſoever was humane: when many times, their owne ſtrength became the ruine of their State; by converting their owne powers, and turning the edge of their owne Swords upon their owne bleeding Intralls; as if they had aymed at nothing more, than to lay their owne Provinciall honour in the Duſt, and to raiſe a new fabricke of Eſtate to ſome other ſurreptitious Nation.

Neither could others miſeries informe them, nor their precipitious falls caution them, nor thoſe numerous Inſtances of mutability recall them.

But I wonder why <hi>Plato</hi> excluded not theſe Hiſtorians, ſince their Labours were proſtitute (like the publick Strumpet) for gaine, making their Writings to the opinion and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Scarabee of Hiſtory, who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why he wrote not truth of ſuch a Prince; replyed: <hi>Vivit, quis vera dicet?</hi> His life kept him in awe, he durſt not expreſſe his vices to the quicke, leſt he ſhould bite too much.</p>

                  <p>It was the excellent ſaying of an impartiall <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,</hi> who being demanded by One who had reduced his Empire to a meere Tyranny; why he remembred not him in his Writings? <q>Becauſe (quoth he) I read nothing in you worth remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring.

                  <p>Many there are, who deſcribe things rather as they ſhould be done, than as they were done. This is not to make a diſcovery of truth, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a forme or Method of what ſhould bee done according to truth. The lives of Princes, and their actions were ever held Modells of imitation for Inferiours. Their very behaviour,<note place="margin">A rule how to rectifie imitation of Errors; by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> were it in ſome geſture never ſo uncomely, h'as ever begot Followers in perſons of meaner quality. To recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie theſe, nothing more powerfull, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more cleare and imitable Examples; that in them, as in living Mirrors, they might diſcover their owne Errors.</p>
                  <p>It was the ſaying of <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi> that thoſe that would live free from vice, had need ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of moſt unfeigned friends, or of moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemies; becauſe, the one by his admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the other by his reproach might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him from vice. Whence <hi>Diogenes</hi> being aſked, how one ſhould be revenged of his enemy? anſwered, by being a vertuous and honeſt man; for his integrity would beget him ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conceit of extraordinary vertue, as hee who maligned him, would hardly endure to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent any place, where he feared to heare his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies praiſe.</p>

                     <hi>Naſica,</hi> when the Roman Common-weale was ſuppoſed to be in moſt ſecure eſtate, becauſe freed of their enemies, affirmed, that though the <hi>Achai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were both brought under the yoak of bondage, yet they were in moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe none were left whom they might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Moſt certaine it is, that very few in all our preceding Ages, unleſſe they were ſuch <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Kings,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> wiſh'd them to bee, could in the height of their fortunes, endure reproofe; eſpecially in ſuch publicke manner, as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by an Hiſtoricall penne.

But to deliver our Opinion freely of diſcourſes in this kind: Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo to be laid open, as the Agent may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive honour, or ſuffer in them. For if in our private Accompts, wee will be cautious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, leſt any thing be omitted or inſerted more than ſhould be: much more in theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts or Regiſters of Time.

                  <p>Mans life may be moſt properly compared to a Lampe: for as a Lampe may be three wayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; Firſt, by outward violence, as when it is blowne out: Secondly, by pouring in much water, whereby the good liquor of the Oyle is drowned and corrupted: and thirdly, by the waſt and ſpending of the Oyle it ſelfe: So likewiſe a Mans life (which in truth reſembles much the nature of a Lampe) is extinguiſhed by three wayes and meanes; to ſecond her reſemblance both in the appearing and extinguiſhing; firſt, by externall force, to wit, of the Sword, fire, ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, preſſing, poyſoning, and the like: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through the aboundance of ill humours, or the malignant quality of them, whereby the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall humour</hi> is oppreſt and overthrowne: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the <hi>Radicall humour</hi> is in long ſpace of Time quite conſumed by the Naturall heate, and blowne out into the Ayre;<note place="margin">Leſſius in Hygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afticon.</note> which is done after the ſame manner, that boyling water or Oyle is waſted by the heate of the fire.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47238:54"/> what is this humour which ſo darkens this divine vigour or truth of an Hiſtorian; but partiality? which ſtreames either from the weake and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Channels of <hi>Puſillanimity;</hi> or the muddy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of <hi>baſe commodity.</hi> For the former ſort, their Spirits are too weake for ſuch a Taſke: for ſuch as will ſuppreſſe Truth, or obſcure the light of their Hiſtory, by ſuffering themſelves to be over-awed by Authority, are fitter to be imploy'd in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <hi>Pigmeis</hi> warres, or of the battell of the <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> than any eminent action. For the latter, their diſpoſitions are ſo unworthy, as they are never to be admitted within the Liſt of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: for theſe preferre traſh before truth, and ſo far under-value that uſefull imployment whereto they ſtand ingaged, as they loſe themſelves by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving gaine from that, which ſhould be from all ſervile fetters freed. Let the firſt conſider, how unfit they are to converſe with Princes precedent, which in their readings they daily doe; who are ſo over-awed by the Count'nance of times preſent, as overcome with feare, they ſilence that which ſhould have bin the activeſt Scene in all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This many times makes a lame diſcourſe: when to ſupply actions of higher conſequence, they impe in needleſſe trifles: ſuch as neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> labour, nor recompence the loſt time of the Reader.

Let the latter, likewiſe, privately converſe with his owne thoughts: and weigh with himſelfe, what a baſe or ſordid gaine it is, to purchaſe to himſelfe honour or preferment by untruths. A Lye is held a word of diſhonour, onely ſpoke by the mouth: what a deepe taint or impreſſion wil it reteine, ſtanding on record? Now to prevent the meanes of publiſhing Subjects of this kind, for profit ſake, as many of our unautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Novells have of late times beene publiſhed;<note place="margin">Ample penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allowed in former times to Hiſtorians.</note> thoſe fore-running ages allowed ample Penſions for their Authors; ſuch as might in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without a neceſſitated beholdingnes to any, maintaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: leſt want of means might corrupt their pen, by making that mercenary, which ſtood ever priviledg'd, and retein'd in it ſelfe a native li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

But as this may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſtrued an errour of life; where the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Author, either in reſpect of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall inordinacy of the Time, chuſeth rather to ſit his Pen to the corruption of the Age, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to her what ſhe moſt affects: or out of a weakneſſe and deficiency of Judgment, preferres a light or laſcivious Subject, ſolely apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave many, improve none; before ſuch as are ſerious, and might tend to the benefit of the Publique, being methodically diſpoſed, and faithfully rendred, as Tranſcripts of that nature, are to be publiſhed. So there is another errour commonly ariſing from ignorance of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, wherein ſuch a Subiect was writ. As the <hi>Greeke,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Latine</hi> copious and fluent: in both which it is very eaſie to offend, either by too childiſh rendring, or erroneous miſtaking of the Originall expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue being of moſt uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of generall'ſt Notion through the World; as alſo for that moſt of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Hiſtories were rendred by faithfull Interpretors in that Tongue, received moſt acceptance: and that not onely in the <hi>Latian</hi> confines, but in more remote places where other Tongues were in requeſt.</p>
                  <p>We read in <hi>Dion Caſſius,</hi> of a principall man in <hi>Greece,</hi> that by <hi>Claudius</hi> was put from the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47238:76"/> order of Judges, for being ignorant of the Latin Tongue.</p>
                  <p>That in all the regions of <hi>Pannonia</hi> it was known: <hi>Velleius</hi> will afford you ſufficient authority.<note place="margin">Vellei. lib. c. Strabo. lib. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>4.</hi> Apulcius in Floridis.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it was ſpoken in a free and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Idiome, in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Affricke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And (to reflect upon more Divine authorities) it ſeemeth that the Sermons of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> yet extant (of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> it is manifeſt) that they preached to the people in Latin. But in the Eaſt parts of the Empire, as in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſo likewiſe in <hi>Affricke,</hi> from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Syrtis</hi> Eaſt-ward, it appeares not in our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nor collection from others, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue ever grew into any common uſe. And the reaſon of it ſeemes to be, for that in thoſe parts of the Empire it became moſt frequent, where the moſt and greateſt Colonies were planted.</p>
                  <p>Now, what abſurdities are and have bin uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed upon ignorance of the Tongue, which they laboured to Tranſlate, I leave to the judicious cenſures of ſuch, who are frequently verſ'd in ſuch Subjects: where they ſhall finde whole pages miſ-conſtrued, whole periods omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereby the Author becomes miſerably mangled.</p>
                  <p>Now, to returne a true levell unto both; as the Originall expreſt acts done in that time vnto life; and, perchance, glanced at ſome egregious abuſes of that Time, or rather diſplayed them in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47238:77"/> their deepeſt colours: So is his <hi>Tranſlator</hi> in an apt and proper phraſe to render him: and if any impertinent, or (which is worſe) vicious paſſages occurre, with a modeſt ſilence to paſſe over them'; rather then by an unneceſſary inſerting of them, informe the preſent age in knowledge of them.</p>
                  <p>In obſerving this, their <hi>Labours</hi> ſhal deſerve to be inchained in our eminent'ſt Libraries, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in them a confirmed fame; while <hi>lighter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,</hi> which receive their beauty from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Time, or adorne themſelves with the quicke-vading flouriſhes of vanity, ſhall incline to the period of an eaſie Fate.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I have entred into a Catalogue of Poëticall Hiſtories, I will proceed further into the memorable, and no leſſe ingenious Works of <hi>Heſiod:</hi> Much I cannot Write of Hyſtoricall matter in <hi>Heſiod;</hi> yet what he writ of that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, comprehended in it more height and true proportion, then any Poët that ever writ. With what hazarding danger doth hee there delineate the rare Combat between <hi>Ceix</hi> and <hi>Cycnus?</hi> Now equally poizing their valours (as if nature had made them of that equall power) to the end to leave the conflict uncertaine. Preſently (upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned advantage) hee ſhewes a better and a worſe: yet ſo, as without the leaſt imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or diſparrage to either of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (making them as imparalell as equall) but applies the event to ſome auſpitious Genius, or Divine Power, favouring one more then another. Straight, with a new paſſage,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47238:77"/> he proceeds to the reſolved exploits of <hi>Hercules;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hercules</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> and with an admirable facility deſcribes his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Hee it was, that by the aſſiſting hand of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> of whom he deſcended, flew the <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Lyon, the <hi>Erimanthian</hi> Boare, the Bull of <hi>Marathon,</hi> the <hi>Lernaean Hydra,</hi> and the winged Hart: Hee who purchaſed no leſſe memorable Trophies in Hell, than on Earth; haling the three-necked <hi>Cerberus,</hi> and reſcuing <hi>Proſerpina</hi> (if the Supreme Powers had not inhibited) from the tyrannick hands of infernall <hi>Pluto:</hi> Diſcomfiting the <hi>Centaures,</hi> vanquiſhing <hi>Achelous</hi> (being his corrivall in the love of faire <hi>Deianira</hi>) the <hi>Stymphalides,</hi> the <hi>Cremona</hi> Gyants, the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous <hi>Neſſus, Antaeus, Augeas</hi> Stables, Apples of <hi>Heſperides, Cacus, Buſyris,</hi> hurling <hi>Diomedes</hi> to his Horſes (to quit his owne tyranny) free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Heſyone</hi> from the Whale, ſacking <hi>Troy</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the perfidious <hi>Laomedon,</hi> ſubduing thoſe invincible Giants, <hi>Dericlus</hi> and <hi>Albion,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming <hi>Orcalia,</hi> and <hi>Betricia</hi> from the captivity of <hi>Gerion:</hi> and wearing the <hi>Amazon</hi> Baldrick, to intimate his victories in thoſe warlicke Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and the like, doth <hi>Heſiod</hi> ſet downe with that probable coherence, that if the matter it ſelfe did not imply an impoſſibility, one would be certainly induced to beleeve ſo concordant an Hiſtory. Preſently he deſcends to the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Gods,</hi> making up a Genealogy in that diſtinct order, as the Pagan Gods (for ſo one hath obſerved) were much indebted to him for

Theſe, by certaine innate ſprinklings of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conferre the Lives and Actions of ſuch, as they read of, in an equall Diameter. Here they obſerve, how <hi>prudently</hi> ſuch perſons managed their affaires; how diſcreetly they moderated their affections: and with what facility and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city they attained their propoſed ends. By which they collect, that deliberation promiſeth ſucceſſe to every action. Amongſt theſe, they finde a <hi>Fabius</hi> more proſperous by delaying; than heady <hi>Cethegus</hi> is by attempting.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth them wiſely and cautiouſly to prevent danger before it approach, leſt a too late <hi>had I wiſt</hi> beget in them a Repentance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out helpe; a deſperate repulſe without hope.</p>
                  <p>It is written that the Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> (that

                     <hi>dainty Darling</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi>) uſed to have borne before him a <hi>Dolphine</hi> wreathed about an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, with this Impreſſe: <hi>Feſtina lentè.</hi> Which elegant Embleme they make excellent uſe of: They conceive by this, how nothing can be done happily, that is done haſtily: and that nothing of high importance can poſſibly be atchieved,<note place="margin">Eucher.</note> being to any ſtrict limit or compaſſe of time confined.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of theſe Motives holds them from raſhneſſe; an errour to which unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Youth is commonly moſt ſubject: by which meanes they avoid thoſe many dangers, whereto the follies of Youth ſtand too frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
                  <p>Nor doe they onely finde Inſtances worthy their Imitation in <hi>Subiects</hi> of prevention and cautious providence: (a Leſſon of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence for Yong-men;) but in actions of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi> where that which is right and juſt, ſhould be fairely and freely rendred to every man. Of this, they finde ſundry ſingular Examples in Ethnicke Authors. <hi>Phocion,</hi> that Honour of <hi>Greece,</hi> will not ſpeake for <hi>Charilus,</hi> though he be his Sonne in Law, but in juſt Cauſes onely. Nor that Worlds Commander, the invincible <hi>Alexander,</hi> incline to his Mother, if her Requeſt tend to the ſhedding of innocent blood, or imbruing his imperiall hands in Murder. Nor that unhappy <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſuffer (in his reſpect of Juſtice) the corruption of <hi>Acilius</hi> to paſſe unpuniſhed: leſt his Impunity might become a Priviledge to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to challenge the like benefit. In theſe they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47238:86"/> obſerve of what eſteeme the profeſſion of Juſtice was in all Ages: and how a native Inſtinct wrought ſuch incredible effects on Barbarous people; as their very Actions merited both imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and admiration in their Succeſſours. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Philoſophers of thoſe times, wherein they flouriſhed, be more exact in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what Juſtice was, than theſe were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what Juſtice requir'd.</p>
                  <p>For our Life, as it is a Globe of Examples; ſo by collecting whatſoever wee ſee imitable in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; if we tender our owne well-being, or her breaſt from whence we had our nurſing and firſt being; wee will take eſpeciall care to expreſſe to life, whatſoever wee have at any time read com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in others.</p>
                  <p>In Arguments likewiſe of <hi>Temperance,</hi> they cull out many dainty Hiſtoricall Flowers; apt to ſweeten the Seed-plot of their Youth with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect variety of Examples.

                  <p>Laſtly, to (exemplifie in each of our Cardinal Vertues, what rare effects may be derived to Youth in theſe Hiſtoricall Readings) they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Conſtancy and Reſolution of forraine Commanders; they admire their <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and braveneſſe of ſpirit.

                  <p>Though an Imperious <hi>Philip</hi> threaten an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Legat, that hee will cauſe his Head to be cut off; he has an Anſwer in ſtore to vye with the mounting Soveraignty of his State:<note place="margin">☜</note>

                  <p>And they finde how gratefull ſome Princes were in the memory of their Subjects Loyalty; holding their fidelity and truſt to be the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parableſt Treaſure that any Prince could enjoy upon Earth. This they conceive by the eſtimate

                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe, they exactly prize the value of true worth. Nor is it to be expreſſed with what ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſſe they purſue thoſe actions, which have purchaſed ſuch deſerving fame to their perſons.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> (that memorable Mirror of Iuſtice) dying of the bite of a Weazle, exceedingly lamented that it was not a Lyon. Noble ſpirits embrace nothing with more eaſie acceptance then an Honorable fate. To die for ones Country; or to be ingaged to the very worſt of extreames for the purchaſe of her liberty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved no ſolemnization in teares: This when youth ſeriouſly ſurveies, he no leſſe affectionately admires; and deſires nothing more then to go on ſucceſſively in a glorious emulation of their actions.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The beſt Doctrine then to initiate us how to be wiſe, is not to be ſelfe-wiſe; but with an humble acknowledgment of our owne defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, to aſcribe all praiſe unto Him who is ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe.</p>

Long time was this unhappy King annoyed, what way ſoever he Travailed: Sea could not ſecure him, nor Land priviledge him. At his repaſt, his ſtomack was made queaſie by their ſtench: and on the night time, by reaſon of their noiſe, was he reft of reſt: In which ſtory, ſundry excellent Morals are dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily couched.

                  <p>By the <hi>Harpyes,</hi> may be underſtood, that there is no Creature, but the <hi>Supreame power,</hi> if Hee pleaſe, can make it his Avenger. But theſe kind of Birds were by the Poëts moſt properly devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47238:106"/> to be purſuers of this bloody Prince. Their ravenous Nature agreed beſt with his temper. For as their Condition is to prey upon their owne; ſo did hee in his cruelty ſeaze upon his owne: And as the Eye is the firſt part which any ravenous Bird uſeth to pick at: ſo it was the Eyes of theſe Orphan-children which their Step-dame <hi>Idaea</hi> aym'd at. Now, whereas theſe Birds are portrayed with Maiden-viſages, we may by that ſafely conclude, <hi>Frontis nulla fides</hi>—: Amiable Features may have ſavage Natures.

                  <p>In the Beaſts of the Forreſt this may likewiſe be obſerved: the <hi>Lyon</hi> (a fierce beaſt) of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roïcke Nature, contemning the dejected ones, nor caring to feed on Carrion.

                  <p>What ſtrange effects of Nature this creature reteineth, may be inſtanced in this notable ſtory.

                     <q>That he could never ſee any Thing, the ſight whereof did not in ſome manner e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie him. Oh, ſayd the other, ſpare a little, good brother; pray you tell me, wherein can the ſight of a Toade edifie you? Oh very much, quoth he; for what have I deſerved that God ſhould make me a Man and not a Toade? So that, as often as I ſee a Toade, ſo often do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call this benefit to mind: rendring all due thankes to him, who according to my deſert hath not formed me like any ſuch deteſtable Creature, but hath beſtowed on me the moſt beautifull and royall image of my Maker.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, as I have formerly obſerved, if our hearts were rightly diſpoſed, by making good uſe of whatſoever in this inferiour Orbe wee ſee here created, and as proper Objects to our eies preſented; we ſhould eaſily confeſſe, that there is no Creature ſo ſmall, vile or deſpicable, which might not be reduced to ſome image or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of our Life; ſeeing, there is none, be it never ſo poore nor contemptible, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents not in it ſelfe the goodnes of God. <q>And ſo by conſideration had of theſe Temporal and

Where Reading of men, and taking a punctuall Survey or Examen of their actions, we become many times wiſer, than if we had beene wholly vers'd in reading of Bookes.

                  <p>Heere they deſcribe fiery-furious Spirits, more ready to attempt than adviſe: Action in theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes before reſolution.

No glowing ſpirit of ambition; no tranſportancy of vaine-glory can leſſen their diſcretion. Their actions are rightly meaſured, becauſe adviſe and deliberation are their Counſellours of State.

                  <p>The ſaying is, Plants tranſplanted ſeldome thrive; No more, Empires, when their ſtate of Government is altered; their ancient Lawes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled; the rule by which they were formerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, wholly relinquiſhed.

                  <p>I muſt confeſſe indeed, that in the dreſſe or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of our Attire, many devices there are (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing ever that they be not apiſh nor gariſh) which give a good grace to the Wearer, and doe better become him, in reſpect of the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are uſed, than if the Old Wardrobes of our Anceſtors were ranſacked, and thoſe ancient Weares brought againe in requeſt.

Nor is this their forwardneſſe forc'd out of want; For many of theſe abound in all fulneſſe; rich in fortunes; Strong in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: Yet miſerable in both theſe. For as their fortunes feed their followers: So doe their followers feed on them. Theſe Faunes are they, who make Fooles of their Maſters; And by throwing out ſtrange lures, miſerably ſeaze on them. The daring <hi>D' Ambois,</hi> and that braue <hi>Byroun</hi> were Spirits of this temper. Great enough in Princes favour; loaden ſufficiently with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; onely vnhappy in this, in that they knew not their owne happineſſe: Miſerable, in that they had never taſted miſery.</p>
                  <p>It is well obſerved by one, in his Diſcourſe of this Subject; that of all frenzies, there is none that madds man more then Ambition. It makes him thinke he walks altogether inviſible; <hi>Ixion</hi> was never more deceiu'd with a Cloud, then he is with his diſguiſe.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more in it; this madding fancy, or raving frenzy is of that nature, as no friend can be ſecure, ſo his fall may purchaſe their aime. <hi>Clitus</hi> Conſtancy cannot ſecure him, when Ambitious heate mixt with Wine, egges on his Maſter to an indeliberate revenge.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſee the juſt doome of theſe! Who, as they build their plottes vpon vnſure Grounds; Or, which is of all others hatefull'ſt, becauſe to themſelues in their paſſage hence the heavieſt, on

                  <p>Then, and never till then, are they brought to acknowledge, that a greatneſſe can be no Subterfuge to guiltineſſe.<note place="margin">Greatneſſe can be no Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Then muſt that veile, which had ſo long ſhrowded them from the ſight of men, be removed; their princely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with their vnprincely actions diſcovered and paralel'd. So poore a Support is <hi>painted Clay</hi> to build vpon.</p>
                  <p>Nor be theſe Ambitious Spirits onely heere to be taxed; who, though they fall, they fly faire: But ſuch, who abuſe that place to which their <hi>Princes</hi> favour hath raiſed them; by baſe mercenary wayes.

                  <p>Secondly, an Explanation in diſcovering, not onely the ſequels of things, but alſo the cauſes and reaſons drawing to the concluſions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Iudgement in diſtinguiſhing things by approving the beſt, and diſallowing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, Stories ſhould be true,<note place="margin">Hiſtories ſhould be true</note> or at leaſt reſemble truth, becauſe by ſo much, they are more pleaſing, by how much they reſemble truth the neerer; and ſo much more gracefull, by how much more probable and leſſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. We haue many Hiſtories (even of this kind) mixed, that comprehend in them nothing leſſe then truth: yet by their ſmooth carriage, and their proper circumſtances with ſuch aptneſſe drained and diſpoſed, they haue beene taken for truth, and regiſtred amongſt Workes of more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Such were thoſe <hi>Apologae Fabulae</hi> (whereof we haue in part ſpoken before) which contained in them many pitthy and graue ſentences,<note place="margin">☞</note> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy obſervation in the excellent'ſt Morall: theſe are fitly called by <hi>Tully, Mirrors of Mans life, Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of Manners, and Images of truth.</hi> Their neere reſemblance of truth, made the Reader more attentiue, ſubjecting his eare to Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes probable, more then to things ſurpaſſing the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47238:133"/> bounds and limits of beliefe; as producing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of miracles (meere conceptions of the braine) phanaticke Chymeras: A Gyant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured in a Rocke, yet able to pierce it through; winne a whole Monarchy with his owne ſingle hands; leade a multitude of Kings captiues, and returne home without a wound. Here ſtrange Inchaunted Caſtles, Ladies and Knights detained in moſt baſe ſeruitude by an Airy Monſter: there admirable victories purchaſed vpon incredible oddes: and the rather to be believed, becauſe it pleaſeth the Painter ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate their vertues.</p>
                  <p>Theſe relations,<note place="margin">☜ <hi>Improbabilities</hi> in all Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call paſſages, highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> as they proceed for moſt part from a conceipt, whoſe wits are long ſince gone a Wool-gathering; ſo to any ſerious judgement they become ſo meerely ridiculous, as they are hiſſed at by the peruſer, howſoever they ſeeme to receiue entertainement by the vulgar. For I haue formerly obſerved, to deſcribe the winning of a Fort, before the approach of a Foe; Or the razing of a Citty, without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of any apparant Enmity, perplexeth the vnderſtanding; and leaues the Conceipt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled. An orderly proceeding in arguments of this nature, deſerve beſt approvement: For the ignorancr or want of obſervance of Order diſtracts the Conceipt, and makes whatſoever is read, tedious to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>In this, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> merits high praiſe. His writings are faire and formall; Hee firſt lieth Siedge; then he proceeds to Occaſionall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47238:134"/> next, he lyes downe the reaſons either of accepting or rejecting what is propounded. Not an improbability will he admit of, leaſt it ſhould impaire the credit of his Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe Warres betwixt old <hi>Aſtiages</hi> and his Grand-child <hi>Cyrus;</hi> wherein much Civill blood was ſhed, before the Empire of the <hi>Medes</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a <hi>Perſian</hi> State; Such principall Allyes as came on in defence of <hi>Aſtiages,</hi> after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate, became ingaged to the like hazard. <hi>Aſtiages</hi> did not onely ſuffer, but thoſe alſo who came to his ſuccour. He then, that ſhould in any weake hiſtoricall relation, averre, that the ſole ground of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his incurſion into <hi>Lydia,</hi>

                  <p>For our antient Hiſtorians deſcribing the firſt occaſionall grounds of all thoſe fatall differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; report, how that <hi>Lydian</hi> King, vpon a long league of amity continued betwixt them, or ſome other propoſitions of reward for ſo neceſſitated a curt'ſie, addreſſed himſelfe with a ſtrong Army for his defence. Yet, by the martiall and experienc'd power of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who were expert Slingers, and of ſtrong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, able to endure any labour; <hi>Cyrus</hi> became victorious; his Enemies, Subjects of his Triumph. Which exploit hee had no ſooner atchieved, then he turned his Sword vpon ſuch as had beene Aſſiſtants to the adverſe part. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as <hi>Croeſus</hi> had ſhowne himſelfe moſt forward,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47238:134"/> ſo he was one of the firſt that he aſſaulted. Then, and never till then, and for no other was this acted then; came the treaſures of that rich Prince to be ſurprized; his princely Pallace to be ranſacked; his ſumptuous Wardroabe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roabed: and he himſelfe expoſed to the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt Cenſure of a commanding Conquerour. Though <hi>Cyrus</hi> Clemency, vpon that ſerious conſideration of humane inconſtancy, pardon'd him his life, and made him his Homager in his owne Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>The like might be inſtanced in thoſe Civill Warres betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi> Though the victorious <hi>Caeſar</hi> had got the day, and made himſelfe happy in the acquiſition of a doubtfull victory; his ambition became not ſo confin'd; nor his hate ſo attemper'd; as to ſtay there. Such, who had vſed their beſt endeavours in defence of his Enemy, muſt feele the heavie hand of his Soveraignty. Though ſome, who were neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allyed to his diſcomfitted Foe, or held in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrious Members of the <hi>Romane</hi> State, were received with a gracefull Countenance: Yea, and advanc'd to vnexpected honours, vpon their ſubmiſſion to his innovated Government.</p>
                  <p>Great was the delight which that <hi>Vniverſall Monarch</hi> of the World conceived in the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> highly, likewiſe, was he taken with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Oracles; the ſtrangeneſſe whereof might beget an <hi>Improbability,</hi> were not the Surveyor his owne Relator: but diſcourſing of every Circumſtance that might any way
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47238:135"/> enliven the Survey of thoſe parts: He expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in a modeſt Majeſtick Stile what he had ſeene or heard: not deriving theſe from others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but from his owne perſonall knowledge.</p>
                  <p>This may appeare in thoſe diſcoveries which he ſo freely communicates in a Letter to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his Maſter: where, amongſt other memorable Sights, he tells him how he had ſeene thoſe two Trees conſecrated to the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> with their Oracular diſcourſe to him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Report of the ſtrangeneſſe of theſe, no doubt, made him retire a little from Martiall affaires; and to take breath a while, that he might more fully obſerue their occult natures and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. For at ſuch time, as this Spreading Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander came into thoſe parts, the Inhabitants there related to him the incredible power of thoſe Trees in this manner. <q>Thou ſhalt ſee (ſaid they) what King ſoever thou bee, two Trees of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> ſpeaking both the Indian and Greeke tongues; The one whereof being a Maſculine Oake, is conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Sunne:</hi> The other Feminine, is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the <hi>Moone:</hi>
                     </q> and by theſe ſhalt thou know what good or evill ſoever ſhall befall thee. This ſaid, the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> to whom, any one that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to enter that Sacred Caue, as they eſteem'd it, were to repaire, told him; That if he were free from the <hi>Vſe</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Women,</hi> he might enter that <hi>holy place.</hi> And ſayes <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> 
                     <q>I obeyed the man in all things, as was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to conforme my ſelfe to a religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47238:135"/> Which done, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> expected when the <hi>Sunne</hi> would ſet. In which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, I carried along with mee my three faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friends, <hi>Perdiccas, Clitus,</hi> and <hi>Philotas.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this Hiſtoricall <hi>Progreſſion,</hi> you ſhall heare what <hi>Alexander,</hi> by way of conſultation <q>demands of the Oracle. "I thought in my mind (ſaith he) to inquire whether having conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole World, I might in <hi>triumph</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into my Countrey, to my Mother <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lympia</hi> and my loving Siſters?</q> Then ſuddenly in the Indian Tongue, and in a ſmall voyce the Tree anſwered: <q>Invincible in Warre ſhalt thou be, <hi>Alexander;</hi> according to thy demand, the Sole <hi>Lord</hi> of the whole world, but returne aliue thou ſhalt not into thine owne Countrey. So haue the Deſtinies decreed touching thy <hi>life.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Alexander</hi> deſcends to ſpeake of the Tree ſacred to the <hi>Moone.</hi> Which (ſaith he) at the very firſt riſing of the <hi>Moone</hi> being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by an horne, having received her full light, anſwered in the Greeke tongue after this ſort. <q>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> (ſaid it) as yet thou haſt not <hi>approched</hi> the full end of thine age, but the next yeare in the Moneth of <hi>May</hi> thou ſhalt dye in <hi>Babylon. By him</hi> ſhalt thou be deceived, whom thou leaſt ſuſpected.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all this (though little beſeeming ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile a <hi>Spirit</hi>) he ſpeakes of thoſe teares he ſhed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Oracular Trees had divined theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Then I wept (ſaith he) and my friends who

                  <p>Theſe relations haue we inſerted, that it may appeare how thoſe things which of themſelves may otherwiſe ſeeme <hi>improbable,</hi> being onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from the mouth of others; receiue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authority by ſo princely a Teſtimony; being confirmed by his owne Eyes and Eares, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to memory for authentick and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth.</p>

                  <p>We read of a people called <hi>Acephaloi,</hi> and theſe haue no heads: and of this ranke are all theſe <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable</hi> Relaters.

By the nature of the Agent, conjecturall events or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of events may be drawne: As if an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man be imployed in Embaſſage twixt Prince and Prince, he is to be ſuſpected that his Treaty will be leſſe happy, in that his illimited paſſions oft-times, rather aggravate then allay cauſes of civill diſcord.

                     </note> and that Aphoriſme to be very true: <hi>Better is an Army of Harts, with a Lyon to their Leader, then an Army of Lyons, having an Hart to their Leader:</hi> And contrariwiſe, the vnhappie events of moſt flouriſhing Empires, the miſerable ſlaughters of moſt puiſſant Armies, by the vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed government of their Agents, or tyranny of their Regents, whoſe improvidence made much people vnfortunate: To ſee <hi>Hanniball</hi> once a Conquerour, becauſe his hopes were not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on in direct meanes; and afterwards by his owne truculent diſpoſition,<note place="margin">☞</note> to become a prey to the conquered, makes this Aſſertion good.</p>
                  <p>No doubt, but the indiſcretion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, becomes the vtter ſubverſion of their deſignes.<note place="margin">The indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, the vtter ſubverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</note> Where, we ſhall finde ſome more apt for command, then to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Others fitter to be commanded, then command. There may be alledged divers reaſons for this. Such, whoſe vnbounded Spirits are ever taken with high exploits, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times more boldly then wiſely, will not ſtick to expoſe their perſons to all perils; ſo they may haue the honour of the day; and beget a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47238:140"/> reverence in their Souldiers. Such as theſe, as I conceive, are fitter to receiue command from another, then to be Commanders of others. For a diſcreet Commander (as I haue formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) is not to ingage his perſon in too deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate attempts.</p>
                  <p>That commanding Regent of the World, was ſometimes highly cenſured for this: when in ſcaling of a Citty, hee would be ſo ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly bold as to mount firſt the Walls; but rather to haue the paſſage prepared, before he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, divers Commanders there haue beene, who eying their owne power, and tranſported with their ſucceſſe; from Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of an Army, haue ſtruck at a <hi>Monarchy. Sylla's</hi> perpetuall Dictatorſhip implyed no leſſe ambition: nor <hi>Sertorius</hi> his keeping himſelfe aloofe from the State, leſſe aſpiring. High Spirits, puffed vp with the glory of their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, are for moſt part ſo inclined. Thoſe tyes, wherein they ſtand ingaged to their Prince and Countrey, are ſleighted; the baſeneſſe of ingratitude they have no mind to thinke on. Ever are they expoſtulating with themſelves, what it is to be ſeazed of an abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, to be ſubject to none; to command all; to haue their Will their Law. To infranchiſe friends; confine Foes; To beſtow a new face on the State. Theſe are the flouriſhes, which ſo delude them, as neither the obedience they owe the State, nor the ſafety of their owne perſons may prevaile
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47238:141"/> with them. Such as theſe are vnhappy agents for themſelues: for howſoever they ſeeme to gather head; and with factious Male-contents to fuell their vnproſperous ſtrength; they ever come home rewarded according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. Faire pretences, as vindicating either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or private wrongs, freeing the oppreſſed State from exactions, eaſing the injuried, and puniſhing the inſolent, receiue at firſt an eaſie impreſſion; but no ſooner ſhall their Complyes obſerve the indirectneſſe of their ends, then they fall from them, leaſt by cleaving too long to them, their greatneſſe faile them.</p>

                  <p>But to diſcourſe of the Civill government of the <hi>Romans,</hi> during their <hi>Democracy,</hi> as they were then Commanders of all neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Nations: So they delighted in nothing more then advancing ſuch, who employed their tongues or penns in defence of the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que liberty: beſtowing not onely Titles on them, well ſuting their demerits; but pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferments too, to recompence their Service. This might be inſtanced in the Eminentſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that flouriſhed amongſt them in thoſe times.

                  <p>Which courſe, were it not duely and exactly obſerved, what inconvenience might probably follow, there is none of a cleare and equall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but may eaſily perceive. For if freedome were given to wanton and luxurious Wittes to write what they would, <hi>Aretines Tables</hi> would receive from every light eye more admiration for true attractive beauty, than the moſt <hi>Serious Piece</hi> that ever was writ either in Philoſophy, Oecononicall policy, or Hiſtory. No; we ſhould have our Stationers ſtalls covered with Libells: where the moſt integrious Spirit might become no leſſe ſubject to a Calumnious Penne, than He, whoſe riſing growth hath expreſt it ſelfe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more from his infancy, than in the increaſe of vice, and practiſe of villany.</p>
                  <p>It is the Authority then of a Cenſurer, that many times deterres a wandring Penne from his freedome of errour. So as, by being regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch <hi>Licence,</hi> he becomes leſſe <hi>licentious</hi> in the courſe and current of his Writing.</p>
                  <p>Nay, there is one thing more, which I ſhall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glance at, purpoſely to induce the ingenuous <hi>Author,</hi> as he values the eſtimate of his owne honour, to ſubmit himſelfe to the candid cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his <hi>Licencer.</hi> And it is this; no doubt, but the too opinionate conceite of every Author
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47238:158"/> complies with the poſitive judgement of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator: "<hi>Writers doe ever doate moſt of their owne.</hi> How needefull then is it, for them to have more <hi>indifferent eyes</hi> than their owne, leſt they delude themſelves moſt, by being too affectionately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with their owne?

And thus much in the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the honour of a juſt Cenſor. And how an impartiall eye may ſave the Author from much diſhonour. Yet to ſpeake a word or two, ſo it trench not too much upon their power, I hold it not amiſſe. The benefit may redound no doubt, being received as it is intended, both to the <hi>Writer</hi> and <hi>Cenſurer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many (which I have formerly touched and taxed) like ſome of our <hi>German</hi> Authors, ſet forth huge Coloſian Bulkes, fadomeleſſe volumes (and if fatherleſſe too, more credit to their fathers) but they have Bodies without Spirits, <hi>Videntur Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri donec inſpexeris.</hi> 
                     <q>They beare the Cover and Semblance of Bookes on them, till you looke in them.</q> Then, and never till then, they ſhew what mettall they are made of. Leane Labours, from fat Authors.</p>
                  <p>It is commonly ſaid, that Law, Logicke and the Switzers may bee hired to fight for any one. Whatſoever they may bee, apparent it is, by their numerous fruitleſſe Editions, that theſe will enter liſts with any <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> upon the leaſt occaſion. No Subject but muſt have their
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47238:158"/> paines and Pennes beſtowed on it. Huge intricate Commentaries, to make the Text more difficult. With ſome of theſe I have encounter'd, and for ought I could perceive by the Genuine Sence of their interpretation, they were ſo farre from the underſtanding of the Author they wrote on, as they might be ſent to ſchoole againe, to learne to conſter him, before they commented on him.</p>
                  <p>The like exuberance is many times ſhowne by many of theſe, in their lighter compoſures: wherein, for moſt part, they offend leaſt. For weake wits beſtowed on weighty Subjects, erre moſt. I have heard of a trifling Pamphletter of this kinde, who after ſuch time, as he had ſpent much waſte Paper inventing ſome weake va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of his owne; wherein he was ever no leſſe conſtant in the choyce of his Patron to whom he Dedicated them, than he was in compiling thoſe corky Subjects which hee addreſſed to him: preſenting one day another light toy; his Patron having peruſed the Title, and divers paſſages in it, requited his Dedication with this witty Jeere: <q>Truely friend, quoth hee, you have writ many fooliſh toyes in your time, but of all that ere you yet writ, this paſſeth them all.</q> The poore Author highly taken with this commendation, not without great joy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the worthy entertainment he received from his Patron: and how highly to his honour, he had commended his Labour.</p>
                  <p>Now to our <hi>Cenſurer;</hi> as his place inferres a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47238:159"/> priority of judgement, ſo I would have him to diſtinguiſh of the utility of Labours. Theſe, who ſpend time, oyle and paper to purchaſe them the Title of Authors: let them be privatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, in daring to preſent ſuch poore ſtuffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of a publicke State. The common Engliſh Proverbe is; "<hi>Better it is to ſit idle, than worke idle.</hi> This may be properly applyed to them. Their fruitleſſe expence of Time and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per makes them farre more uſeleſſe to the State, than if they wholly retired themſelves from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Truth is, theſe deſerve no cenſure; they are placed in too low a Siege. A milde reprofe will better beſeeme them; telling them, how by all likely-hood, if any ſuch ſhould be ſuffer'd to goe abroad, or receive priviledge by authority, the next time that either he or any of his family ſhould goe to the Grocer for their ſpicery, little doubt but ſome of his ſhaken leaves would bee return'd him, with ſweeter contents than ever he beſtowed on them.</p>
                  <p>Whereas SUCH, whoſe earely and late Studies have highly improved their knowledge, and whoſe diſcretion (a ſmall graine whereof would be very uſefull to many of our Schollers) hath ſufficiently inform'd them what is fit or accommodate for the time; be the Subjects they treate of Hiſtory, Antiquity, or other Diviner E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements: theſe, I ſay, well deſerve the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a judicious <hi>Cenſor.</hi> For to uſe the words of our Moderne <hi>Democritus:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If Learning and Diſcretion be not ſufficient to make up an Author; what may wee expect from him that ha's neither?</p>
                  <p>Some of our <hi>Cenſurers</hi> have heretofore beene not unlike to ſome of our active Lawyers; who in peruſing of their Clients pleadings, uſually razed out what was moſt pertinent: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon a more ſetled judgement, wrote <hi>STET</hi> in the Margent, to all that which they had formerly razed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Multi dum caſtigant, caſtrant; dum mutant, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.</hi> Many, too many, while they ſeeme to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, they diſtract; while they alter, they torture.</p>
                  <p>But approved <hi>Cenſors</hi> are of another nature (of which we were never better furniſhed in a competent number:) for theſe are of that <hi>true touch,</hi> as neither gaine may corrupt them, nor the Authors perſon worke upon them, but the worth of the worke: this onely hath power to procure a priviledge from them.</p>
                  <p>But let me ſtay a little, that I may make an end the ſooner; ere I proceed to the true diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47238:160"/> of Hiſtories, I muſt caution two ſorts of Men, which (in their Reading) pervert the uſe and ſcope of Hiſtory,<note place="margin">Two ſorts of ſiniſter Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 1.

                  <p>Theſe cannot taſte any thing well, that is not abſolute; yet for their judgement a <hi>Venetian</hi> Aſſe may out-ſtrip them:<note place="margin">Superbire eſt ſupra regulam ire.</note> He is (unmeaſurably proud) wiſe in his owne conceite, hath an Orbe in his braine,<note place="margin">An Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Reader, an incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Cenſor of an others La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> which ever turning round, makes his judgement braine-ſicke.</p>

But as Fortitude of body derives her Eſſence from the imbecility of the Minde, and the ability of the Minde from the debility of the body: So the Authors glory is oft-times revived, and augmented by the ſting of Detraction, as the Detractors infamy by the Authors glory: Vertue alone is crowned, Vertue in her ſelfe,<note place="margin">Haec eſt quae f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, for the <hi>Phraze;</hi> as I have formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the beſt direction, that ſuch, who have already writ of that Subject, have recommended; all the better, to imprint this in your memory; it is to be underſtood, that no <hi>Phraze</hi> of Speech better becomes theſe Relations, than ſuch as are briefe and ſententious. I have knowne ſome, in their Additions to certaine pleaſing Inventions of our owne; by labouring to ſurpaſſe their Coppy
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:47238:166"/> (left imperfect, and falling into their nice hands to make compleate) through an affected Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of phraze,<note place="margin">☜</note> to have darkned the meaning of the Author: by furniſhing the Story with an Ocean of Words, but ſcarce one droppe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The <hi>Phraze</hi> then muſt be ſo diſpoſed, that the matter whereof wee treate, muſt not through affectation become intangled, nor any way obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wherein a great meaſure of diſcretion is required: Yea, and in one and the ſame Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the <hi>forme</hi> of the <hi>Phraze</hi> may be changed. Light Subjects are ever properly ſuited with light Lines. But when we addreſſe our Diſcourſe to deſcribe the Subverſion of a State; the depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any flouriſhing City: ſtill from the Tragicke aſhes of ſuch a Story, may our Penns bee taught to droppe Teares. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentment of Sorrow that ſuites well in the ſame Habit or Colours, that Subjects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light are to be attired in. When that Nation, our Hiſtorian hath occaſion to write of, ſhall be cloathed in mourning garments; when fire and fury attend them without, feare and famine within: <q>
                        <l>When their weake VValls are ſo inclos'd about,</l>
                        <l>That feare gets in, but nothing can get out.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then muſt his <hi>Phraze</hi> of Speech put on an heavy dreſſe. Elegancy never leſſe beſeemes him than at that time. Paſſionate Enter-breathes; Treaties of Sorrow; Eare-moving expoſtulations

                     <hi>Benzo</hi> in his Indian Story expreſſeth a ſingular Art in his diſcovery of Paſſion in this kinde; who relating the cruelty of the Spaniſh Nation practiſed upon the Weſt Indies (if the Hiſtory hold concurrence with truth) collects a Summary of all in this one preſidentall report: In one of their Ilands called <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> of twenty hundred thouſands, when the people ſtood untoucht (which had they remain'd ſo ſtill, might have redounded more to the honour of that Nation) the Author was verily perſwaded at the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Hiſtory, that there were ſcarce a hundred and fifty ſoules left; whence he exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">Benzo in Hiſt.

                  <p>He ha's in ſtore a Catalogue of unexemplary Tyrants, for ſuch unexemplary miſchiefes. Paſſion in Diſcourſes of this nature (which is farre better expreſt in abrupt ſighes, than poliſh'd ſpeech;) will become well the penne of an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. Another Style is to bee uſed in peaceable Treaties, Nuptiall Solemnities, or Orations by way of Embaſſie and the like.</p>
                  <p>In the diſtinguiſhing then of theſe, as I have formerly noted; is much diſcretion required. For to uſe any Style that may not ſuite with the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> whereof he treates, argues a want of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Author: reſembling ſuch ridiculous Actors; who, whether they ſpeake of Heaven or
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:47238:167"/> Earth, fixe their eyes alwayes on one place: or whether they ſpeake of warre or peace, ever reteine one tune in their ill-diſpoſed voyce. Shall we then a little longer inſiſt upon ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, for matter of Style, as either impaires or improves the beauty of an Hiſtory? Heare what my opinion, derived in part from others, is in this.</p>
                  <p>Theſe beſeeme not a Hiſtory; dilated circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, inſtances too much ſtood upon, an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous leaving of ſomething undetermined: They leave the underſtanding in doubt what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, the judgement what to thinke, the thoughts what to deliberate: So as our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conferres no other profit, ſave an intricate winding or wreathing of many anxieties up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Giving the Minde free ſcope to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the event, being implyed by the Author.</p>
                  <p>An Hiſtorian in his writing ſhould have a kinde of ſeeming ſecurity for his Style and Order of Speech: yet not ſo,<note place="margin">Non ubi vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati feſtivitas propriè cedit.</note> (as to omit an exact or wittily compoſed jeſt) to reliſh the Readers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte: Such was <hi>Tacitus</hi> uſe, by enterlacing the ſeriouſneſſe of his Tale, with ſome judiciall (but ſtrangely briefe) ſentences: annexing ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſtraine, either of meere purpoſe invented, or from the occaſion of his Subject derived, to ſweeten the heavier part of his diſcourſe: which ſhould not be too long inſiſted on, for that were trifling; but ſhadowingly touched, for that implies plenty of Subject: not flying to triviall relations, to make up a greater Volume, but

                  <p>Shee ever hated converſing with Earth: her Contemplation was in an higher Spheare.

                  <p>Truth is, there is nothing which this <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme</hi> enjoyes, that hee can properly entitle his owne. For as thoſe Temporary Bleſſings which hee h'as received, are eſtranged from his uſe: ſo the very thoughts of his heart are not his owne, becauſe they are ever fixing on anothers Farme. Hee ſees nothing flouriſh in anothers Paſture, but the Object of it begets his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

                  <p>It is good providence (for ſo hee guilds his

So as, that Cynick tooke not his marke amiſſe, when reſolving one day to diſtinguiſh a Land-buyer from a Seller; a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Chuffe from a ſociable Good-fellow; tooke his ayme by their Phyſnomies. If hee ſaw one plumpe-fac'd, ruddy-complexion'd, cheerefully countenanc'd, quick-ey'd, hee would accoaſt him with this Salute: "Sir, are not you a Seller?
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47238:173"/> But when he ſaw one of a leane meagre Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, chop-falne, earthy complexion'd, he would preſently alter his conjecture upon ſight of his Feature, and greete him thus: <q>In good ſadneſſe, grave Sir, are not you a purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer?</q> Whence we may ſafely conclude:<note place="margin">Optimam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in mundo habet, qui mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimam habet.</note>

                  <p>Nor can this unprofitable care of a wretched Worlding, become any way uſefull to him in his dying. His Teſtament is made; and he leaves in it what he is unwilling to leave.

                  <p>Now, this excellent Vertue, or if you will,<note place="margin">The bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many noble Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide.</note> Ornament of Majeſty, derives her Originall (as may be probably gathered) from two eſpecial Fountaines: <hi>true Iudgement</hi> in diſcerning; and <hi>charitable benevolence</hi> in commiſerating. For whenſoever it ſprings from theſe, Bounty may ever give a reaſon of what it gives, and to whom it imparts it ſelfe. For though the greatneſſe of the gift winne grace and love to the giver; yet the ſeaſon or opportunity of giving makes it more effectuall to the receiver.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Fabius,</hi> whom we formerly remembred,<note place="margin">Examples of opportunate bounty, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Store-houſe of Hiſtory.</note> ſhewed ſingular arguments of this bounty, whoſe example we the rather preſſe afreſh, becauſe the <hi>Opportunity</hi> of his bounty added to the eſtimate of it: The gift beſtowed was but ſmall, but the ſeaſon made it great. A little ſumme of money inlarged the continuance of his memory. For
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47238:176"/> having redeem'd at <hi>Hannibals</hi> hand, the liberty of ſuch priſoners as had beene taken by him, in thoſe Warres. When the City of <hi>Rome</hi> would not diſcharge that ſumme, for which he had articulated: he ſent his owne Sonne to <hi>Rome,</hi> purpoſely to ſet at ſale the whole Farme he had from his Anceſtors. He valued little his owne Patrimony, in regard of the redemption of a Priſoners liberty; and ſo free his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whoſe fame he prized above Life, from breach of promiſe, and ſo deepe a brand of infamy.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we ſhould account the price of what he gave, it was but ſmall. This Hereditary Farme conſiſted but of ſeaven Acres, and thoſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Papinia:</hi> but when we conſider the mind of the Giver, we ſhall find no maſſe of money ſo great, but it appeares greater. The Inheritance of his Predeceſſours muſt be ſet at ſale, rather than his indeared Countrey ſuffer the leaſt ſtaine. He had rather loſe his Farme, than ſhee ſhould loſe her Fame. Wherein he ſeemes by his noble endeavours to deſerve greater commendation, ſhewing himſelfe ſo willing to extend his bounty (in an act of ſuch neceſſity) even to the utmoſt of his ability; farre out-ſtripping ſuch, who give farre within their power, or from their ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for whereas the One beſtoweth what he may, the Other more than he may.</p>
                  <p>No Lines, were they never ſo full of Life and Memory, can ſufficiently advance that aſpiring Spirit of <hi>Roman</hi> Liberality; when after the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47238:176"/> of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> all <hi>Greece</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together to bewitneſſes of ſuch a Spectacle; <hi>Quintus Flaminius</hi> (of whom I ſhall occaſionally ſpeake hereafter) commanding ſilence by the ſound of a Trumpet, commanded theſe words to be publiſhed by the Cryer: <q>The Senat, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Queſtors of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Flaminius</hi> her Generall, command that all thoſe Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> which were under the late dominion of <hi>Philip</hi> ſhall enjoy all freedome and infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement.</q> Which words were no ſooner heard, then thoſe people taken with a great and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted joy, at firſt, as if they had not beleev'd their owne eares, they kept ſilence. But when the ſame words were re-delivered by the Cryer, to enforce more credit in the Hearer, they deafned the Aire with ſuch a ſhrill ſhout, as for certaine the very Birds which flew above them, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and raviſhed with the ſound, fell from the Aire.</p>
                  <p>Surely, it was an argument of a nobly-diſpoſed mind to free ſo many Captives from reſtraint, and to beſtow the ſame liberty upon them, which the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> glorious by her many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, had ſometimes beſtowed on their richeſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And to adde a greater luſtre or majeſty to that worke of bounty, it conduceth much to commemorate not onely the liberality of the Giver, but the free aſſent or approbation of the people to that Gift: for as there is a Commendation due to the act recorded, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the praiſe it ſelfe deſervingly rendred.</p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:47238:177"/>
                  <p>But while <hi>Rome</hi> ſends forth ſuch noble Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who in ſo flouriſhing and fruitfull a Mother beſtowed all honour, her owne Munificence ſhould not be buried in ſilence.

                  <p>When <hi>Rome</hi> had taken all <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſhe beſtow'd it as a gift upon King <hi>Attalus,</hi> to poſſeſſe; imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the Soveraignty of her Imperiall City would appeare ſo much more glorious and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, if ſhe beſtowed the richeſt and pleaſantſt part of the World for a benefit to another, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than keepe it as a ſtore-houſe for her ſelfe.

                  <p>Right well I know (to cloſe in opinion with <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) <q>that there is no reading more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate, no Diſcourſe better ſuiting men of

                  <p>In his judgement, then, as no Diſcourſe is more requiſitely familiar than with Hiſtorians; ſo he holds <hi>Livie</hi> to be the Prince of all Latine Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and fitteſt to be a Gentlemans acquaintance.

                  <p>For his Style (as I have elſe-where noted) it was nothing ſo darke nor conciſe as that of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus.</hi>

                  <p>For the Epitomes of theſe, as <hi>Luc. Florus</hi> and others; me thinkes they may bee compared to ſhort Commons.

                  <p>Touching <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> his writings ſtand more upon <hi>Apothegmes</hi> than <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> He takes Survey of ſuch eſpeciall Vertues and Vices as preſſed moſt upon thoſe times.

A brave ſpirit diſplayed in every action. One, who knew how to vanquiſh; and how to moderate his felicity. One, who if he were not what he was, could chuſe with all his heart to be a poor Philoſopher. One, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt his Military affaires, and managements of State, would deagne to talke with learning: purpoſely to improve himſelfe as well in Arts as Armes.

                     <hi>Megabizes</hi> eſteemed <hi>Alexander</hi> as a Prince whilſt he ſtood in his Schoole and ſaid nothing, but when hee began to talke of things which he knew not: he ſaid unto him, that <q>Even his little Children would, laugh him to ſcorne.</q> This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front could that great Commander beare with a Princely patience: and labour by his owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and the inſtruction of an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Maſter, to redeeme his ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Though a Cynick teach him mortality in an homely manner: and encounter him with moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sculls in his triumph to his Countrey; he will ſcarcely reprove him for it, but uſefully apply it, and benefit more by it, than by all thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had conquered.</p>

                  <p>Yet muſt his <hi>Errours</hi> be touched, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of an Hiſtorian may become approved.

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47238:194"/> Not a pleaſant paſſage but merits approvement from his Pen. None more ſerious, when he deſires to be weighty; none more delightfull, when the Subject admits a freedome to be witty.</p>
                  <p>For our Greeke Ethnick Hiſtorians (for of thoſe Eccleſiaſticall Writers, we ſhall ſpeake of them in their due place;) none comparable to <hi>Plutarch</hi> for Hiſtoricall Morality; nor to <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides,</hi> for State and Majeſty; nor to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> for Method and Perſpecuity; nor to <hi>Herodian,</hi> for a quick and active Diſcovery; nor to <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> for a rich Philoſophicall Delivery.

                  <p>But theſe, as I obſerved, wrote onely upon the Actions of thoſe times, with the quality of the Perſons intereſſed in thoſe Actions: being both for matter of Diſcipline and ſervice eſtranged from us, and conſequently reteine leſſe affinity with us.

                  <p>This is the reaſon that we ſee ſome ſo delighted with the ſweetneſſe of Reading, as obeying their owne pleaſure, they looſe the ineſtimable fruits thereof.

                  <p>There be alſo (but of theſe there be but a few) whom new, and unaccuſtomed things do delight (men of vulgar apprehenſion) who hearing the State of Emperours, for the moſt part, more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the Purple then the Man,<note place="margin">Qui ſtupet in titulis &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginibus.</note> the Picture then the Work: So effectuall a force doth Hiſtory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and imprint in the Mind of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Now it is the ſcope, and draught of all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to excite mans ſloath, and to arme him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all dangers; and whereas the force of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (then which nothing can be imagined more powerfull to perſwade) tend eſpecially to that end; it commeth to paſſe that by the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of men (who thinke other mens harmes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing to concerne them) ſuch things (as

And this difficulty is no leſſe then the other: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Writers do deſcribe things done, as they do not only carry favour, but follow their owne appetites (like ſome Builders) ever interpoſing their own peculiar judgments,<note place="margin">Artif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We are oft-times therefore deluded by theſe two meanes, our owne Judgement, and the prejudice of the Author, not laying things open and naked, as they were done.</p>
                  <p>An Hiſtorian is the beſt interpreter of Acts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved; whoſe judgment, if it chance to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, it commeth to paſſe, as when Wine (of it ſelfe neate and generous) taketh either ſome waft of the Caske, or is corrupted by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtaſt, which either proceeds from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, or folly great &amp; intollerable. We may ſee in one only example, the judgment of the Writer; The prophane Hiſtorian aſcribeth the events of ſerious and weighty affaires, to the councell and induſtry of men; al-be-it he hath ſufficiently tried, how fowly thoſe men were deceived in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. Hence it is that men be drawne to great folly; that they, whoſe knowledge was ſcarce ſufficient for the conſideration of things ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before their eies; and whoſe force and ſtrength not much exceeded little Wormes, ſhould by one ſmall ſucceſſe arrogate the government of the whole world unto them. But a good Hiſtorian teacheth thus: <hi>Things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are purpoſed by

But eſpecially I admoniſh thee to this end; that whereas I obſerve many Authors of that kind, who for their exceeding force of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable examples, deſerve to be read; I could wiſh that the Novice-reader diſcuſſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as circumſpectly and ſeriouſly as he can, by propoſing to himſelfe both the fruits which might redound, and the dangers which might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre him in his reading: for to one that runneth over all Hiſtories curſorily, or who raſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly ſpends his time without any exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of private or publicke duties, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe as to Country Clownes, who in ſacking of a neighbour City, take ſpoile of ſome <hi>Apothecaries</hi> ſhop well furniſhed with all receipts; where, provoked with the ſweetneſſe of ſome junkets or ſpices, being the firſt that came to their hands, and imagining the reſt to be of the ſame ſort, they ſwallow, ſup up, devoure, and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandize all before them; whereby preſently ſome are taken with a ſtrange diſeaſe, others with a Phrenſie, moſt are bereft of life, none but ſtrangely diſtempered, which occaſions laughter through all the Army: <hi>For as Mans life, (ſo Hiſtory

And his reaſon is, that one who reteines the Elements of all Knowledges, though they be but in a weak meaſure, yet hee can deliver himſelfe by way of Diſcourſe in what Subject ſoever ſhall be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: whereas Hee, who hath confin'd himſelfe to an exact ſight of one Knowledge, and no more, being out of that Element, wherein hee is ſolely exquiſite, he muſt veile to other mens Diſcourſe, and keepe conſort with Silence.</p>
                  <p>Now, to inable you for all Companies, no ſtudy may better accommodate, nay accompliſh you, than the knowledge of <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> So as <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carouſe old Graines with <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his Diſh, than new Grapes with <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Cup; "For of all the Gods (quoth he) I love not <hi>Aeſculapius:</hi> preferring conference with a Philoſopher, before the ſociety of a Scepter: and imbracing an abſtemious courſe of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, before Feſtivall and Epicureall mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.

                  <p>In our election then of Company (as I have many times obſerved) let it be our care ever to

So, in this incomparable Feaſt of Hiſtory, where Diſhes ſtored with all variety of diſcourſe are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up, if you come with diſtempered judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not diſtinguiſhing what is wholeſome from what is noyſome, that which might have redounded to your infinite profit, by inverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the right uſe, returnes to your detriment.

Others, like low-growing Plants, or earth-kiſſing Violets, though to the Eye of the World, they ſeeme contemptible; yet try them, and you ſhall finde them ſweet and comfortable Conſorts; though ſleightly obſerved, deſervingly approved,</p>
                  <p>You ſhall find how thoſe men, who, as <hi>Coſmo</hi> ſaith, carry their heart in their mouth, are more

                  <p>Thirdly, He compares ſome of our <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to <hi>Builders;</hi> interpoſing their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar judgements, and imping their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, by which they many times divert the Scope of their Hiſtory.

And this errour falls many times upon a preſuming Reader, as well as the originall Author. For many of our Criticks, who hold <hi>Minerva's</hi> Anvill to bee in their Braine, cannot read a Line without a Cenſure: and theſe for moſt part delight in nothing more than catching and carping at an errour.<note place="margin">Ad reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, he compares theſe glozing-ſugred <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> to <hi>Cookes;</hi> who (for the moſt part) uſe to preferre their Maſters Palat before his profit. Such as theſe delude their Gueſts with guilded Plates, and indented Paſtes. But guilded meates will never allay hunger. Profit and pleaſure mixt together make the beſt muſicke. The ſmell of Meat can no more feed the belly; than the ſound of money fill the Purſe. <q>There be ſome wholeſome things indeed (ſaith that ſinnowy <hi>Seneca</hi>) which without either touch or taſte,<note place="margin">Sen. de Tranq. anim.</note> profit much with their ſmell.</q> But by theſe, the <hi>Morall</hi> meant no materiall Flowers: Thoſe internall graces or beauties of the mind, which had received ſweetneſſe from Philoſophicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, were thoſe ſweete fragrant Odours he meant by. But to preſſe this Compariſon a little farther: Our <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> ſhould not be ſuch <hi>Cookes,</hi> as onely to intend a pleaſing of the Senſe. There is more in Hiſtory, than delighting a youthfull appetite. He then that deſires to have his Workes live to poſterity; or in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages to reteine his Memory; muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme theſe pleaſing humours of complying either with Time, or with any One; high in favour with Time. It was the Poëts reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:

                  <p>Fiftly, Hee compares the judgement of an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> when it becomes corrupted, to <hi>Wine;</hi> (which of it ſelfe neat and generous) taketh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome waft or unſavoury taſte from the Caſke, or is corrupted by ſome other accident.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>el meipſum neſcio, vel in alio meipſum Sentio:</hi> I ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know not my ſelfe, or in another I ſee my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Might we aſſume that freedome which <hi>Plutarch</hi> enjoyed, in a Paralell of preceeding with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times; the perſons and actions preſent with thoſe that went before us; we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne as neare a reſemblance in ours, as ever he did in the Symbolizing of his Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> found <hi>Miltiades</hi> ſpirit in himſelfe. Such like noble minded Perſons ſhould we finde in ours. Others, like <hi>Palinurus,</hi> or a love-ſicke <hi>Paris,</hi> more apt to encounter with love, then to ingage themſelves in any other Liſt. And neare reſemblances might we cull out aſwell for theſe as thoſe: both for Campe Honour and a Carpet Lover. Which might prove a ſingular motive to excite Valour, even in thoſe, whoſe remiſſer ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſtood before ſo rebaited, as they might take a perfect draught of their owne Phyſnomies by that white-liver'd Captaine, who looking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a Glaſſe when he was angry, was affrighted
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:47238:223"/> with his owne countenance. Whereas, contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, true Heröick Spirits, who never tooke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of one unmanly feare, might find o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo lively reſembling them, as if they lineally deſcended from them.</p>
               <p>Such a Survey of Honour might rightly merit the Title of the <hi>Noble-mans Lecture:</hi> Laying downe ſuch deſerving grounds of Courtiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, Martiall proweſſe and Chriſtian pollicy, as might attract unto them an eagre deſire of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Nor in this NURSERY OF GENTRY ſhould the quick-ſighted Reader find only diſcourſe for Noble Perſonages to regulate themſelves by; in the view of others actions and diſpoſitions, with the reſemblance they find in themſelves both of their actions and diſpoſitions: But even ſuch, who have beſtowed much precious time in a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary life,</hi> ſhall obſerue others no leſſe affected that way, then themſelves. That neare reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, no doubt, which Divine <hi>Plato</hi> gath'red from the report of <hi>Phocions</hi> diſpoſition,<note place="margin">☞</note> and his, (confirmed by intermiſſive Letters and other motives) drew him forth of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> for no other cauſe but onely to ſee <hi>Phocion,</hi> ſo much endeared to him by the report of his vertues, and neare reſemblance in converſation.</p>
               <p>In this reſpect, our <hi>Hiſtory</hi> may well deſerve the Style of the <hi>Muſes Wardroabe.</hi> Or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Continuation of her <hi>Mixt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> ſtored, for the Readers more delight, with all variety, be properly entitled, <hi>The Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

               <p>Nor is it to be queſtioned, but as wee ſee faces in their favour ſo nearely reſembling one another (though they have no relation to one an other in blood) as they can hardly be diſcerned one from the other: So likewiſe, in the inward favour or feature of the Mind, there is ſuch an harmony or Divine Symmetry, as there can be no nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the Eye, in thoſe parts or linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body.</p>
               <p>How much then, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> may <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſeeme to deſerve your Love; when you may ſee in it as in a Mirror, the Image of your whole Life? This is no ſuch deceiving artificial Glaſſe, that by the remoteneſſe of your Object, makes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things ſeem great, and great little: for this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a true proportion to the face of every action.</p>
